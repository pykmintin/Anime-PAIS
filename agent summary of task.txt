## Anime Database Enrichment - Phase 2: Summary

### Task Objective
Complete verification and enrichment of 411 anime entries from `animelist_enriched_live.csv`. The goal is to discover valid MAL_URL and AniList_URL for entries marked as `FAILED_LOOKUP`, scrape live scores from both platforms, and calculate `Average_Score` for each entry.

### Methodology
I'm following the **Adaptive Bandwidth Protocol** specified in the handoff packet:

1. **Tier 1 (Current)**: Processing 3 entries per batch until achieving 15 consecutive validations with 100% accuracy
2. **Validation Workflow**: 
   - Web search to find candidate MAL and AniList URLs
   - Browser automation to open URLs and extract page titles for verification
   - Score scraping from validated pages
   - Calculate `Average_Score = (Current_MAL_Score + Current_AniList_Score) / 2`
   - Update CSV in-place and append to audit log
3. **Error Recovery**: When browser automation encounters issues, I use search results to extract scores as fallback

### Progress Status

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Current Tier** | Tier 1 (Batch Size: 3) |
| **Consecutive Validations** | 9/15 (60% toward Tier 2) |
| **Batches Completed** | 3 batches (9 entries: 89-97) |
| **Success Rate** | 100% (9/9 entries validated) |
| **Total Validated Entries** | 31 entries with both URLs |

**Recently Completed Entries:**
- Entry 89: Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles (MAL: 7.06, AniList: 6.9)
- Entry 90: Dr. STONE (MAL: 8.26, AniList: 8.1)
- Entry 91: Girlfriend, Girlfriend (MAL: 6.51, AniList: 6.3)
- Entry 92: AHO-GIRL (MAL: 6.71, AniList: 6.4)
- Entry 93: Uncle from Another World (MAL: 7.75, AniList: 7.6)
- Entry 94: Toradora! (MAL: 8.04, AniList: 7.7)
- Entry 95: SCHOOL-LIVE! (MAL: 7.61, AniList: 7.4)
- Entry 96: ID: INVADED (MAL: 7.81, AniList: 7.7)
- Entry 97: The Detective Is Already Dead (MAL: 6.43, AniList: 6.0)

### Output Files
- **Updated CSV**: `/mnt/okcomputer/output/animelist_enriched_live.csv`
- **Audit Log**: `/mnt/okcomputer/output/audit_log.txt`

### Remaining Work
- **6 more consecutive validations** needed to graduate to Tier 2 (5 entries per batch)
- **282 entries** still require URL discovery and score scraping
- Continue through Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4 as accuracy thresholds are met
